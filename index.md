### About Me

A `Support Engineer` at `Elastic`, based in `Bangalore`.

I’m passionate about helping developers and organizations get the most out of Elasticsearch, whether it’s powering real-time search, observability, or security use cases. 

I love working at the intersection of data, performance, and user experience, especially when integrating tools with Elastic Stack to build robust, real-time pipelines.
